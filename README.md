# Google-Adsense-Report-Looker_Studio
# Google AdSense Analytics Dashboard Project

This repository contains a comprehensive **Google AdSense analytics project** built using a simulated multi-website dataset and visualized in **Looker Studio**.  
The project focuses on analyzing monetization performance, user behavior, traffic distribution, and ad quality metrics that are critical for publishers and analysts.

The dashboard is designed to reflect how AdSense performance is evaluated in real-world environments, going beyond basic revenue reporting to include engagement, viewability, and policy-risk indicators.

## Project Purpose

Most AdSense dashboards stop at impressions, clicks, and CTR.  
This project was built to answer deeper analytical questions such as:

- Which websites and pages actually drive revenue  
- How traffic quality impacts monetization  
- Whether ads are viewable and healthy  
- Whether there are early warning signals related to invalid clicks or coverage loss  

The primary goal is to demonstrate **end-to-end analytics thinking**, not just data visualization.
